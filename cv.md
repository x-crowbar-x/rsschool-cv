## About me

I am very passionate about technologies and I always want to know more about them. Also, I am communicative and I am very fond of talking about tech all day through. The major turning point for me was when I first tried Linux. I liked it so much, that I wanted to learn ins and outs of this operating system. I am still learning, but I already feel that I have become a "power user". And after that I felt like I can succeed in anything. Although I have little to no experience in frondend, I am not backing down and will continue to develop new skills, as I believe that learning something new is always a very exiting and rewarding experience.
